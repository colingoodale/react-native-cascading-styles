# Architectural Decision Document: Component Library Philosophy

Welcome to our component library! We've built this library with a focus on flexibility, extensibility, and reusability. Our goal is to empower developers to quickly build applications while retaining full control over styling and functionality.

## Architecture Decisions

### Minimal Default Styles

We provide minimal default styles for our components, allowing developers to start building without being tied to a specific look and feel. This approach enables rapid prototyping and proof of concept development without the need to override excessive default styles.

### Maximum Functionality

While our components come with minimal default styles, they offer maximum functionality. We've designed them to be highly customizable and extensible, allowing developers to tailor them to their specific needs. Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, our components provide the flexibility to meet your requirements.

### Support for Large Apps

Our library is well-suited for large applications due to its focus on minimal styling and avoidance of className-based styling. Instead, we encourage developers to use inline styles or inject custom styles as needed. This approach reduces the complexity of managing styles across a large codebase and promotes consistency and maintainability.

### Plug-and-Play Validations and Behaviors

In addition to styling, our components offer plug-and-play validations and behaviors. Developers can easily integrate validation logic or custom behaviors into their components, enhancing their functionality without sacrificing reusability. This modular approach allows developers to mix and match validations and behaviors as needed, promoting code reuse and scalability.

## Guiding Principles

- **Flexibility**: Our components are designed to adapt to various design systems and project requirements. Developers have the freedom to customize styles and behaviors to suit their specific needs.

- **Extensibility**: We provide hooks and extension points for developers to add custom functionality to our components. Whether it's adding new validation rules or extending default behaviors, our components can be easily extended to meet diverse requirements.

- **Reusability**: Our components are built with reusability in mind. By focusing on minimal default styles and plug-and-play functionality, we encourage developers to reuse components across different parts of their applications, reducing duplication and improving code maintainability.

## Conclusion

We believe that our component library offers a balance between flexibility and functionality, making it suitable for a wide range of projects. Whether you're building a small prototype or a large-scale application, our components provide the building blocks you need to create powerful and customizable user interfaces.

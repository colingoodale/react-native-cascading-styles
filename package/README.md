## Installation
```sh
npm install react-native-cascading-styles
```

## Usage

### Styles

You can pass a structured array to a component to apply the styles from the style library:

```jsx
import { StyleLibrary } from 'react-native-cascading-styles';

return <View style={[StyleLibrary.ClassName1, StyleLibrary.ClassName2]}></View>;
```

### Components

Import and use components from the library.
```jsx
import { Component } from 'react-native-cascading-styles';

return <Component prop1="value1" />;
```

### Animation

#### Using Animation Hooks
Hooks provide a simplified interface for creating animations. This method is useful if you want to integrate animations directly with your own components for more control and uniformity.
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useAnimation } from 'react-native-cascading-styles';

const MyAnimatedComponent = () => {
  const { animation, startAnimation } = useAnimation();

  return (
    <View style={animation}>
      <Button title="Animate" onPress={startAnimation} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

#### Using Animiation Components
Animation components wrap your components and manage the necessary props to simplify the usage of animations. This approach is slightly more restrictive but much easier to implement for common use cases.
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { AnimatedComponent } from 'react-native-cascading-styles';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <AnimatedComponent>
      <YourComponent />
    </AnimatedComponent>
  );
};
```
